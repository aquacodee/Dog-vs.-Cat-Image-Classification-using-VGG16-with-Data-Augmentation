# Dog-vs.-Cat-Image-Classification-using-VGG16-with-Data-Augmentation
Python script for performing image classification of dogs and cats using the VGG16 pre-trained model with data augmentation. The script loads a pre-trained VGG16 model without the top classification layer, adds custom layers for binary classification, compiles the model, and trains it using a dataset of dog and cat images.
